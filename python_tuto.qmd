## Setup

Online options:

- **Jupyter notebooks:** easiest is to download the Anaconda Navigator (comes with a lot of heavy software you probably won't use)

- **google colab :** (+) has google installed libraries and GPU power (limited to xxx GO). (-) to make one you need a google account, but you can also just follow mine:


## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
